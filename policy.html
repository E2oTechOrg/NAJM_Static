          <p>At NAJM Engineering Ltd, we are committed to protecting your privacy in accordance with the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) in Canada and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. This policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you interact with our website or submit data through our forms.
          We may collect personal information such as your name, email address, phone number, and resume when you apply for a job or contact us through our website.

          <h2 class="mt-5">Payment Policy</h2>
          <p>NAJM Engineering Ltd follows a transparent and contract-based payment system. All payments are made in accordance with mutually agreed-upon project scopes, milestones, or deliverables, which are documented in formal proposals or service agreements. We do not currently support online payments via this website. All transactions are handled via bank transfer, cheque, or other agreed-upon offline methods.
          Invoices are issued based on project progression or completed milestones, and clients are expected to remit payment within the stated due dates. Any late payments may incur applicable fees as per the contractual terms. Taxes, including federal and provincial sales tax, will be applied as required by law. Any change to this policy will be communicated in writing before service engagement.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">Cancellation &amp; Refund Policy</h2>
          <p>We understand that project needs may change. Clients may cancel services by submitting a written request. Cancellation terms and any associated costs will depend on the project stage and the contract terms agreed upon.
          Refunds are considered only under specific conditions—such as when work has not yet begun or when cancellation occurs within an agreed cancellation window. No refunds will be issued for services already rendered or partially completed. Any eligible refunds may be subject to administrative or processing fees. This policy ensures fairness for both parties and maintains the integrity of our project timelines and resource allocation.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-5">Shipping / Delivery Policy</h2>
          <p>NAJM Engineering Ltd does not provide physical products. All deliverables, including reports, engineering drawings, and technical documentation, are delivered digitally via email or cloud-based platforms. In certain cases, physical submissions may be arranged as per contractual agreement or regulatory requirements.
          Delivery timelines are agreed upon at the beginning of each project and depend on the project scope, regulatory approvals, and third-party dependencies. All efforts are made to meet agreed delivery schedules, and any delays are promptly communicated to the client.</p>
